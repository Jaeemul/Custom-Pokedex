# Custom-Pokedex
It is an app that will search for Pokémon by name or ID and display the results to the user. I used freeCodeCamp's PokéAPI Proxy, (https://pokeapi-proxy.freecodecamp.rocks/) to retrieve the data and images of the Pokémon. 
This is the final project that I did for my frontend development learning journey with HTML, CSS and JS
